## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Despite Aadhaar's 1.3+ billion enrollment base, **16.650717703349283% of districts exhibit high exclusion risk**, 
characterized by low enrollment rates, child underenrollment, and demographic instability.

### Key Findings
- **174 high-risk districts** identified across 49 states
- **Children (0-5)** disproportionately excluded in bottom 10% districts
- **Migration patterns** (demographic updates) correlate strongly with exclusion
- **Biometric authentication failures** persist in tribal/rural areas

### Solution
Deploy **100 Mobile Enrollment Units (MEUs)** to priority districts in **3 phases over 21 months**.

### Impact
- **450,000 people** reached
- **₹254.01 crores** economic benefit
- **3403.6% average ROI**
- **15-20% exclusion rate reduction**
